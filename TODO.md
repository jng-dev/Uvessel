- [x] installer should display what version it is installing
- [x] if an existing version already exists ui installer switches to updating mode, meaning auto close when done, and have some ui changes via text and visually different to indicate its an update
- [x] add an uninstaller.exe if possible, or register some way to uninstall
- [x] allow for atomic install, if it fails during install we clean the leftovers
- [x] find a way to pipe in the terminal output from the install into the installer, so the user can see that something is happening (direct pipe into the ui would be dope as fuck)
- [x] imrpove the look and feel of ui installer
